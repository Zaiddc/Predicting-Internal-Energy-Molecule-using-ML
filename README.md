# Predicting-Internal-Energy-Molecule-using-ML
The model was trained on a dataset of molecules with known internal energy values using 
machine learning algorithms, and the performance of the model was evaluated with a 
specific metric and hyper-tuned.
The developed model achieved high accuracy and could predict a molecule's internal energy
with acceptable precision. Moreover, the accuracy score and a table showing the predicted 
and actual output will be presented at the end.
The results of the thesis showed the potential of machine learning in predicting the internal 
energy of molecules in computational chemistry. The developed model could be a useful 
tool for researchers in the field of chemistry for quick computation and obtaining precise 
predictions of internal energy, which is a crucial parameter in many chemical reactions.
